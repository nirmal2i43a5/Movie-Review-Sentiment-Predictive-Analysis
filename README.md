## Project Overview

- This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using the IMDB dataset. The goal is to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative** using **TF-IDF** techniques and **Word2Vec**.

- The analysis follows a structured pipeline including data preprocessing, feature extraction, exploratory data analysis, and model training using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec** representations with Random Forest Classifiers.

- **Data cleaning:** Removes HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords from reviews.
- **Feature engineering:** Adds review length and punctuation percentage as extra features.
- **Text vectorization:** Uses both TF-IDF and Word2Vec to turn text into numbers.
- **Model training:** Trains Random Forest models to classify sentiment.
- **Evaluation:** Checks accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Prediction:** Lets you test the model on your own review text.

## Why does this matter?

- Quickly understanding audience sentiment helps studios and platforms respond to feedback and improve recommendations
